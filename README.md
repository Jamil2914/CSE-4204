# CSE-4204
This is a repository containing the codes I have written while completing my undergraduate sessional course CSE-4204(sessional based on Neural Networks & Fuzzy Systems)
This contains below mentioned problem related codes:
1. Two points are given in a definite coordinate system which represents two different clusters initially. The task is to observe how the K-nearest neighbor algorithm works for addition of each new point to the existing coordinate system and assign that point to the nearest cluster. The system must contain the ROGUE pattern.
