# CSE-4204
This is a repository containing the codes I have written while completing my undergraduate sessional course CSE-4204(sessional based on Neural Networks & Fuzzy Systems).
This contains below mentioned problem related codes:

1.Two points are given in a definite coordinate system which represents two different clusters initially. The task is to observe how the Nearest neighbor algorithm works for addition of each new point to the existing coordinate system and assign that point to the nearest cluster. The system must contain the ROGUE pattern.

2.Two points are given in a definite coordinate system which represents two different clusters initially. The task is to observe how the Nearest neighbor algorithm works for addition of each new point to the existing coordinate system and assign that point to the nearest cluster. The system must not contain the ROGUE pattern and the distance of the new point from the 2 clusters must be calculated based on the average value of the distances to each point of the clusters respectively.

3. Single Layer Perceptron algorithm is to be implemented. No. of bits to represent all the features, weight values, threshold value are to be taken as input in a generalized process. The program should show each of the updated weight values and finally it will show the output of final weight value which satisfies the correct prediction for each level of data table.
